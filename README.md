# Passie

A memorable, secure password generator. 🔐

## About

Passie is a password generator based upon the 'Fletch' method. A while ago a friend told me how he keeps passwords, using a key that's memoriable to start then shifting the service he's logging into one key to the right, making it easy to remember and enter. 

EG: !ligbw>hpph;r
EX: KEY=(! = random char, Linux is good but Windows is greater), SERVICE=(Google == hpph;r)

## Why?

There are multiple advantages to using this method of creating passwords. These include the following;

* Every password per website will be unique, with differences that any good cyber security expert should pick up on.
* Easy to remember, if you're a password manager.
* Hard to break, if you're breaking it on a Casio 83GT Calculator.
* Records are saved, in memory for less than a second.

Also, this program was created to demonstrate how easy it is to use this method as most people I have tried to explain this to in the past have found it hard to understand. Now, the process is explained, automated and saved all for you.

## Setup 

Download the files for the bot and make sure Python 3.6+ is installed. After you have completed these steps, simply open `passie.py` and follow the on screen instructions.

## Anything else?

Just keep in mind as with every password, if it is made too simple it will be made easier for methods such as brute forcing to break into your account. Just remember to keep things secure..
